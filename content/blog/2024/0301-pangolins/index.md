_From Wikipedia_

Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order
Pholidota. The one extant family, the Manidae, has three genera: Manis,
Phataginus, and Smutsia. Manis comprises four species found in Asia, while
Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in sub-Saharan
Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of
extinct pangolin species are also known. In September 2023, nine species were
reported. [^1]

## Description

The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large, hardened, overlapping,
plate-like scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal
matures.[citation needed] They are made of keratin, the same material from which
human fingernails and tetrapod claws are made, and are structurally and
compositionally very different from the scales of reptiles. The pangolin's
scaled body is comparable in appearance to a pine cone. It can curl up into a
ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armor, while it
protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing
extra defense from predators.

## Behavior

Most pangolins are nocturnal animals which use their well-developed sense of
smell to find insects. The long-tailed pangolin is also active by day, while
other species of pangolins spend most of the daytime sleeping, curled up into a
ball ("[volvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvation)").
